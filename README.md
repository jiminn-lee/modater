# modater
easily update your minecraft mods!

## stuff to do
- use either node.js or rust to extract jar files in mode folder into modater folder.
- filter extracted contents so only json and maybe icon.png remains
- read json data and show list accordingly
- use data to check if mod is up to date and compatible with selected version
